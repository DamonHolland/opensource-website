## Code of Conduct

Read our [**Code of Conduct**](/code-of-conduct) to understand how we operate in open source and what we expect of contributors.

## Open Source Categories

All New Relic open source projects are [**categorized**](/oss-category) to help contributors, developers, and customers understand what to expect and how to engage with our projects.

## Contributing

New Relic open source projects follow a [fork-and-pull-request](https://gist.github.com/tangollama/5d9d63fef0ed4498fb5fbb057bb5983d) workflow for project contribution. If you're new to open source contribution, the content on [**this page**](/contributing) will help.
