The video above walks you through the details expressed below. For a more technical or detailed description of this process, you can consult [**this link**](https://gist.github.com/tangollama/5d9d63fef0ed4498fb5fbb057bb5983d) or similar documentation across the open source world.

For those new to the concept, the following points encapsulate the major steps and issues.

## Fork a Repository

As opposed to requiring write access to the open source repository, a [**fork**](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/fork-a-repo) allows you the ability to modify code and contribute changes via a [**pull request**](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Navigate to the repository in GitHub and click the **Fork** button.

## Implement changes on your Fork

Now that you have a copy of the repository in your own _writable_ space, you can implement your changes against your forked copy of the code but executing the `git clone` command, and modifying your copy of the code.

### Commit message guidance

As you `commit` changes to your **fork**, you want to ensure that your commit messages are human-readable, relevant, descriptive, and follow a standard methodology so that tooling can automate the creation of **Changelogs**, etc.

To support that, New Relic open source projects seek to follow the [Conventional Commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification) for `git` commit messages.

#### Please ensure

1. That your commit messages follow the [Convention Commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification).
2. That your commits tie back to a specific [**Issue**](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) in the upstream repository (_hint: if there isn't an issue for your change, add it yourself :)_ ).

## Initiate a Pull Request to the New Relic repository

Once you've committed your changes to your fork, you can now issue a [**Pull Request**](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) back to the New Relic project.

## Accept the New Relic CLA (Contributor License Agreement)

Finally, if you've not contributed to a New Relic open source project before, we're going to prompt you to electronically sign our [**Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**](/cla), highlighting that you're freely providing code to for the benefit of the open source project and community.
