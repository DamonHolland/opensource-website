Workloads GeoOps provides a geographic exploration of [Workload](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) data (collections of Entities) tied to geographic data, including location metadata. Find additional information in the project's [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) directory.
